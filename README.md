# Ryan's gitblog
## A blog on github
### Maybe the first; probably the last

I thought about all the features I would want a blog to have if I was going to write one.
I got super excited to start on another half baked side project that would never see a single visitor.
I'm glad (I think) that when it dawned on me that I basically wanted a git browser I resisted the urge to spin my own.
And now you have it. A commit into a blopo or a rego. Somebody please submit a PR into this when you figure out what the hell it should be called.
